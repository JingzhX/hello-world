# hello-world. Just a start to learn how to use github. 

Hi all,

Jim here. I think we next need to use the pathway based anaysis to find our interesting targets. Then use them as our baseline to go further. This would help us identify many more chemicals of great important. We can do some test first and see what will happen.

Dear all,

Thanks for Martin's suggestions on how to combine all the databases of PPI and IPA. I think we should set up a public repo to share all the useful databases we have. Please send me a datasheet recording the databases you are using now.
